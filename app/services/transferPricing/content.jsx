            <p>
              Whilst transfer pricing has long been an acceptable taxation
              strategy all over the globe, the current China government is
              tightening the tax loop-holes at a rapid pace, and catching many
              companies in breach of the laws with the transfer pricing
              regulations rapidly developing in China. Moreover, the Chinese
              authorities even target transfer pricing adjustments as a major
              tax revenue earner in the years to come. FIEs in China are
              required to report annually their transactions between related
              parties and have been frequently questioned whether arm's length
              prices have been adopted. Under China's transfer pricing rules, it
              is easy for two companies to be considered "related parties",
              while in many other countries the same parties may not be
              considered associated. Therefore, it is very important for FIEs to
              assess their transfer pricing risks as well as prepare appropriate
              documentations for the transfer pricing policies for China
              operations in professional measures.
