            <h3>Setting up in China</h3>
            <h4>How to decide the investment vehicles?</h4>
            <p>
              The most direct way to penetrate the China market is to set up
              local presence.There are various forms of investment vehicles
              available to suit different business objectives and
              operations.Hendersen can help you to find out the most appropriate
              investment vehicles from the business, tax and legal perspectives
              based on the comprehensive understanding of your business
              objectives and investment plan in China.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Setting up a representative office has been the simplest way to
                get into China and gain on-the-market experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Other than financial institutions, a foreign company still
                cannot set up a branch office in China at the moment.
              </li>
              <li>
                The target's financial information is not sufficient to work-out
                the financial model or business valuation
              </li>
              <li>
                If your investment involves a Chinese partner, you should
                probably go for setting up either a Sino-foreign equity joint
                venture or a cooperative joint venture.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise will allow you
                greater management control and flexibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                The setting up of a foreign-invested holding company or
                management company is another relatively new option.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Normally a foreign investment enterprise ("FIE") is set up for a
              specialized purpose with a specific business scope. Apart from the
              traditional production FIEs, foreign investors may now also set up
              trading FIEs, service FIEs, wholesale and retail FIEs, etc. If
              your group has already established a number of FIEs and is poised
              to make further investments in China, you may consider
              establishing a China holding company to centralize management,
              provide shared services, consolidate the distribution of goods
              produced by your FIEs in China and pre-market certain imported
              products. Upon having paid up its registered capital according to
              the approved schedule, your FIE may also expand its geographical
              coverage by setting up branches.
            </p>
            <h4>Where to set up?</h4>
            <p>

              set up your business in China.Hendersen can help you to select
              several appropriate locations based on the practical client
              experiences and your business objectives.Subsequently, Hendersen
              can perform a detailed location study to obtain the following
              information for each selected location:

            <h4>How should I go about the setting up?</h4>
            <p>
              Before setting up in China, you should review your current
              investments and future business plans to determine the optimal
              investment vehicle to set up in accordance with the current China
              investment regulations and WTO market access commitments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The steps of setting up in China must be carefully planned.The
              following are some points that you cannot afford to miss:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In case of forming a joint venture, seek support in contract
                negotiation and due diligence review.
              </li>
              <li>
                Verify the feasibility and prerequisites for setting up because
                they could be subject to local differences in practices and
                interpretations of the law.
              </li>
              <li>
                Optimize the tax-effectiveness of your shareholding structure
                and funding arrangements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Formulate the business scope for the company to be set up and
                negotiate with the approval authorities where necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure the application documents for submission are complete,
                accurate and in the right format.
              </li>
              <li>
                Find out the appropriate channel for approval and registration
                and go through them one by one.
              </li>
