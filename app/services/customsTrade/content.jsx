            <h3>Common Issues</h3>
            <p>
              Companies in China often encounter the following issues relating
              to customs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Entry time varies significantly sometimes. It is often affected
                by some very minor mistakes in tariff classification or customs
                valuation or affected by customs audits which are selected on a
                random basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Although China generally follows the WTO principles on customs
                valuation, there are some different local interpretations, e.g.,
                on royalties. It creates some difficulties to replicate the
                existing contractual models in WTO countries directly to China.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are still many grey areas in the PRC customs rules, e.g.,
                in lease importations, which leads to difficult to implement
                some well developed business/financial models in the western
                world.
              </li>
              <li>Importation of used equipments is difficult.</li>
              <li>The rules of origin is much more complex today.</li>
              <li>
                Lack of ownership on customs function. Usually, customs is a
                matter that everyone (logistics, legal, tax, finance) cares but
                no one owns.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
