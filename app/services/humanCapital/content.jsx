            <h3>Common Issues</h3>
            <p>
              Companies in China often encounter the following issues relating
              to human capital:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Turnover rate is high. People in China switch jobs much faster
                than the western world. There is an overall difficulty to retain
                people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Job market is not transparent. Qualities of new hires vary a
                lot.
              </li>
              <li>
                Every different province adopts a different social security
                scheme. For many new comers, it is easy to neglect the social
                security cost in addition to an employee's gross pay, which
                could be an addition cost of 40-60% on top of the total pay.
              </li>
              <li>
                As China develops, employees' cost structure changes very fast.
              </li>
              <li>
                Payroll system is not automated, and heavily relies on manual
                work. It increases the processing cost as well as leads to the
                issue of confidentiality.
              </li>
              <li>
                Individual income tax rate in China is among the highest in the
                Asia Pacific Regions, careful planning
              </li>
              <li>
                It is difficult to implement a global equity based compensation
                plan in China due to the foreign exchange restrictions.
              </li>
