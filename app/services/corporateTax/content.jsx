            </p>
            <p>
              During recent years, the China tax authorities are tightening the
              administrations on tax collections. Failure in reporting or
              payment of taxes properly can lead to penalties (maximum 5 times
              of the outstanding taxes) and surcharges (about 18% per annum on
              the outstanding taxes). In extreme case, the business of the
              entity will be cancelled and the management will be exposed to the
              public. Hence, tax health checks are very important and are
              popular among FIEs in China for risk management purposes.
            </p>
            <p>The main benefits from a tax health check include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To assess the overall compliance level of the China operations,
                identify non-compliance areas and grey areas and work out
                appropriate course of actions to minimize the tax exposures;
              </li>
              <li>
                To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the operating
                structure as well as tax and regulatory functions;
              </li>
              <li>
                To provide practical programs to improve the operational
                effectiveness and efficiency of the above functions;
              </li>
              <li>
                To identify possible planning measures that can derive net
                savings and streamline cash flows.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              A tax health check review would normally focus on the following
              types of China corporate taxes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Foreign enterprise income tax</li>
              <li>Withholding tax</li>
              <li>Business tax</li>
              <li>Value added tax</li>
              <li>Consumption tax</li>
              <li>Urban real estate tax</li>
              <li>Deed tax</li>
              <li>Stamp duty</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This list basically covers the taxes that FIEs would be subject
              to. Depending on the needs of the entity concerned, this list
              could be further changed.
