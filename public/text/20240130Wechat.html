  We are pleased to inform you that Hendersen Taxand launches our AI assistant
  on an experimental basis. First of all, you can play around with it at

<p>What is it?</p>
<p>
  Year 2023 is the year of AI. With the emergence of various Large Language
  Models (“LLM”), picture/video generation models and various related
  applications, people in various trades are experiencing the impact of AI on
  how they live and how they work.
</p>
<p>
  While many people may have doubt about the effectiveness of AI in handling
  some complicated tasks traditionally handled by human, changes are probably
  already on the way...
</p>
<p>
  Thus, our app aims to conduct an experiment using AI in the professional
  field. It utilizes our knowledge and experiences generated in our professional
  work, establishing an AI knowledge base and provide an easy-to-use human-AI
  interface to access such knowledge and experiences.
</p>
<p>The Issue</p>
<p>
  A major issue regarding using AI in the professional field is "AI
  hallucination". The term "AI hallucination" refers to a phenomenon in which an
  AI model perceives patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible
  to humans, resulting in nonsensical or inaccurate outputs. In human
  language-AI lies, sometimes.Well, even frequently.
</p>
<p>
  This type of AI hallucination is often seen in large language models such as
  GPT and can occur due to various factors such as biases in the training data,
  unexpected inputs, or errors within the model itself. These hallucinations can
  lead to incorrect predictions and sometimes generate harmful content such as
  hate speech or misinformation.
</p>
<p>This is not acceptable in the professional field!</p>
<p>How it Works？</p>
<p>
  While building AI models using deep learning techniques where the model learns
  by itself without any prior human intervention has shown immense potential in
  several applications like natural language processing (NLP), image recognition
  etc., such models sometimes suffer from errors due to lack of generalization
  abilities on unseen examples. In such cases, incorporating relevant external
  knowledge through a knowledge graph or ontology during model training phase is
  often found helpful.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, at application level, a possible solution is to use an external
  knowledge base as context when AI addresses a specific question. In this
  regard, vector embedding is a technique used in natural language processing
  (NLP) to map words or phrases onto numerical vectors. The process of vector
  embedding involves representing words as high-dimensional vectors, where each
  dimension corresponds to a specific feature.
</p>
<p>
  The main goal of vector embedding is to capture the semantic meaning and
  context of words within a language corpus. By doing so, it enables machine
  learning algorithms like neural networks and decision trees that work with
  numerical data inputs to understand the meaning behind textual input.
</p>
<p>
  By transforming your knowledge to a vector database, it also provides a means
  for AI to search the most relevant context to specific questions. Unlike
  traditional search, which is based on words, the vector search is based on
  meaning.
</p>
<p>
  Based on our experiment, AI hallucinations can be reduced significantly using
  the correct context, i.e., knowledge base by implementing the vector database
  store.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, we are building up our knowledge base, make it understandable by
  AI, and let AI do the job.
</p>
<p>Looking forward</p>
<p>
  There are other means to improve the quality of AI responses. Reinforced
  learning, fine tuning using LORA, prompt engineering, etc. These will be
  rolled out step by step in our experiment.
</p>
<p>
  The use of AI as Agent is another important area to look into. The process
  involves creating a system that can interact with humans in a natural and
  effective way, performing defined tasks on behalf of the user. With detailed
  planning, AI can perform much more complicated tasks in a very near future.
