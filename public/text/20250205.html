<p>An overview by Garrigues, Taxand Spain</p>
<p>
  The Spanish Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) has recently clarified that
  dividends and capital gains benefiting from Spain’s participation exemption
  are considered fully exempt under the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime.
  This means foreign holding companies receiving such income are not required to
  declare it in Spain.
</p>
<p>
  Nicolás Cremades Leguina and Inés Mora-Figueroa Cruz-Guzmán from our Spanish
  member firm Garrigues have published an examination of some of the key points,
  which include:
</p>
<p>
  - CFC Regime Application: Income from a foreign subsidiary must be reported if
  taxed at less than 75% of what it would be in Spain.
</p>
<p>
  - Full Exemption Status: The DGT ruled that Spain’s participation exemption,
  despite a 5% deemed management expense, does not compromise its full exemption
  status.
</p>
<p>
  - Implications: Dividends and capital gains exempt in both Spain and the
  foreign country are treated equally (0% tax), eliminating CFC reporting
  obligations.

  incompatibility with international double taxation relief. You can read the
